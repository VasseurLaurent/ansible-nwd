# V0.8

NEW FEATURES :

* Possibility to define variables in subfolder in the defaults folder
* Possibility to define molecule scenario with driver ```delegated```. The table created will have every parameter defined in the scenario
* If a default variable is too "long" (100 characters), a related link will be added to the documentation instead of the value

FIX :

* Still parsing if the file molecule.yml is not in the role folder
* Still parsing if there is no tag defined in the role
